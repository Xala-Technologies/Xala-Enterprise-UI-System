### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Timeline pressure for remaining 44 components
- Testing infrastructure not yet in place
- Documentation lagging behind implementation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Prioritize high-traffic components first
2. Implement testing in parallel with migration
3. Document patterns as reference for AI agents
4. Use automated tools for repetitive migrations

---

## 🎉 Conclusion

The design system migration is progressing well with 8 stories completed and a solid foundation established. The token system, theme system, and core component patterns are proven and working. With 44 components remaining to migrate, the project is on track for completion within the planned 6-week timeline.

The parallel agent approach has proven effective, with specialized agents handling different aspects of the migration simultaneously. The established CVA pattern from the core components provides a clear template for migrating the remaining components efficiently.
