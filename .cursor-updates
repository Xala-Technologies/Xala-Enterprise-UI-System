  - Platform detection: Multi-platform support utilities

### 🔧 Critical Build Fixes Applied

- Fixed accessibility utilities (wcag-aaa.ts): Resolved 37 syntax errors
- Fixed validation utilities: Corrected string method calls
- Fixed platform tokens: Resolved split() method errors
- Fixed platform index: Cleaned up malformed object structures
- Fixed RTL tokens: Corrected method calls and syntax

### 📊 Current Status

- **Version**: Bumped to 2.0.1 for release

- **Critical Issues**:
  - MobileLayout.tsx: 153 structural errors
  - Semantic token system: 44 errors
  - Core library: 11 type/export errors

### 🎯 Architecture Improvements

- **Modular Design**: Large components split into focused, single-responsibility modules
- **SOLID Principles**: Each module has a clear purpose and interface
- **Type Safety**: Explicit return types, no 'any' types, comprehensive interfaces
- **Norwegian Compliance**: Centralized compliance features across components
