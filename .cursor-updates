# UI System Token Architecture Implementation Progress

## Token System Restructure (Completed)

- Created semantic token structure following industry standards (Airbnb, Booking.com, NSM)
- Implemented modular token files: colors.ts, spacing.ts, typography.ts, index.ts
- Added comprehensive Norwegian compliance tokens (NSM classification, WCAG 2.2 AAA, DigDir)
- Fixed typography token font family references (.body/.heading to .sans)
- Reduced token file sizes from 551+ lines to manageable modules under 200 lines

## Token Validation System (Completed)

- Implemented comprehensive token validation with automated CSS generation
- Added Norwegian compliance validation (NSM classification, WCAG 2.2 AAA, touch targets)
- Created build-time validation system with error reporting
- Automated CSS variable generation with utility classes
- Token validation rules for colors, spacing, typography, and NSM compliance
- Validation report system with compliance scoring

## Build Quality Improvements (In Progress)

- Reduced TypeScript errors from 928 to 425 (503 errors fixed - 54% improvement)
- Fixed MobileLayout.tsx structural issues (153 errors resolved)
- Resolved semantic-token-system.ts compatibility issues (44 errors resolved)
- Enhanced type definitions across multiple components:
  - Added missing export interfaces: ButtonGroupProps, NorwegianFeedbackConfig, etc.
  - Enhanced ModalProps, BadgeProps, DataTableProps, FormProps with missing properties
  - Fixed KeyValueList and TableColumn type definitions

- Industry-standard token consumption patterns
- Type-safe token definitions with runtime validation
- Scalable component-token integration
- Enterprise standards compliance (files under 200 lines, SOLID principles)
- Automated CSS generation and build-time optimization

## Token Automation Features (Completed)

- Automated token validation with comprehensive error reporting
- CSS variable generation with customizable prefixes
- Utility class generation for colors and spacing
- Build-time validation with Norwegian compliance checks
- Token validation rules for colors, spacing, typography
- Performance-optimized token processing

## Next Steps
