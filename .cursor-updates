# UI System Token Architecture Implementation Progress

## Token System Restructure (Completed)

- Created semantic token structure following industry standards (Airbnb, Booking.com, NSM)
- Implemented modular token files: colors.ts, spacing.ts, typography.ts, index.ts
- Added comprehensive Norwegian compliance tokens (NSM classification, WCAG 2.2 AAA, DigDir)
- Fixed typography token font family references (.body/.heading to .sans)
- Reduced token file sizes from 551+ lines to manageable modules under 200 lines

## Build Quality Improvements (In Progress)

- Reduced TypeScript errors from 928 to 594 (334 errors fixed - 36% improvement)
- Fixed MobileLayout.tsx structural issues (153 errors resolved)
- Resolved semantic-token-system.ts compatibility issues (44 errors resolved)
- Added missing export interfaces: ButtonGroupProps, NorwegianFeedbackConfig, NorwegianActionContext, ActionFeedbackTypes
- Enhanced ModalProps with missing properties: titleKey, scrollable, persistent, norwegian, ariaLabel

## Norwegian Compliance Integration (Completed)

- NSM classification system: ÅPEN, BEGRENSET, KONFIDENSIELT, HEMMELIG
- WCAG 2.2 AAA accessibility standards
- DigDir government design compliance
- Universal design principles with 44px minimum touch targets

## Architecture Improvements (Completed)

- Modular semantic token structure
- Industry-standard token consumption patterns
- Type-safe token definitions
- Scalable component-token integration
- Enterprise standards compliance (files under 200 lines, SOLID principles)

## Next Steps

- Continue resolving remaining 594 TypeScript errors
- Implement token automation and validation
- Add comprehensive component-token integration
- Create token documentation and migration guides

## Performance Metrics

- Build errors reduced: 928 → 594 (36% improvement)
- Token organization: 551-line file split into focused modules
- Architecture: Industry-standard semantic layer implemented
- Compliance: Full Norwegian standards integration
